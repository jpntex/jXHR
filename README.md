# jXHR.JS [![Appcelerator Titanium](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/titanium-git-badge-sq.png)](http://appcelerator.com/titanium/) [![Appcelerator Alloy](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/alloy-git-badge-sq.png)](http://appcelerator.com/alloy/)

## Description
jQuery's `$.ajax` method with deferreds for Titanium Alloy

## How To Use
1. Copy both `jXHR.js` and `q.js` to your `app/lib/` folder.

2. In your `index.js` add the following lines:

  ```javascript
  // Promisses Library
  var Q = require('q');
  
  // AJAX Library
  var $$ = require('jXHR');
  ```

3. Then just call it, like this:
  ```javascript
  $$.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1').then(function(e) {
		Ti.API.debug(e);
	}).fail(function(e) {
		Ti.API.debug(e);
	});
  ```

  or like this:
  
  ```javascript
  $$.ajax({
    url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1',
    type: 'GET',
    success: function(e) {Ti.API.debug(e);},
    error: function(e) {Ti.API.debug(e);},
    complete: function(e) {Ti.API.debug(e);},
    async: true,
    timeout: 10000,
    parse: true
  });
  ```
